# Mehmet Aziz Yirik

I am a PhD student at [Friedrich-Schiller University Jena, Germany](https://cheminf.uni-jena.de/members/mehmet-aziz-yirik/). My PhD research topic is the development of open-source chemical graph generators, an application of [algorithmic group theory](https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/AlgorithmicGroupTheory). In the field, MOLGEN was the fast and efficient structure generator but a commercial tool. In my PhD, I developed two chemical graph generators. The first one is [`maygen`](https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/MAYGEN) [1] and the second one is [`surge`](https://github.com/StructureGenerator/surge). Chemical graph theory and its applications in chemistry were also reviewed[2,3]. `maygen` was based on orderly generation method. While working on it, I also tried integer partitioning based chemical graph generator, called [PartGen](https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/PartGen); however, this trials trigger the great algorithm `surge`. After noticing that all the functions I need are already provided in [`nauty`](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/) package [4], we worked on the nauty based structure generator, `surge`. 

The applications of chemical graph generators are not restricted to only chemistry. In astrobiology and the generation of new amino acid libraries, these generators can be used. I will soon share our new article! My interest in graph algorithms started in my bachelor. I took topology, geometry, group theory and graph theory courses in my last year; moreover, worked on the symmetry groups especially wallpaper groups and the symmetry groups of Archimedian and Platonic Solids at [Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, Mathematics department](http://mat.msgsu.edu.tr). However, I was interested in the implementation of these theorems to understand nature better. The symmetry of the creation amazed me and I would love to learn this beautiful artwork as much as I can. However, just the pure mathematics knowledge was not enough and there was something missed: The education in computer sciences. A day, I was watching a dancer, then started thinking about the correlation between the music and the brain. That thoughts brought me to a new research area: computational neuroscience. I took my master degree from the [Computational Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.boun.edu.tr) of Boğaziçi University. My master thesis was [Development of a Data Collection and Analysis Tool for Protein-Ligand Interactions](https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=7lOJX8w_8PRQU1mSHU6-jn4VRvIQ1oN1tNxI0PvyHdJeCWgKnFIML1jgh29OJnni). Besides the development of the tool, I also worked on the protein-protein interaction network analysis of sphingolipid and insulin metabolisms playing crucial role in the treatment of neural diseases such as Alzheimer & epilepsy. The source code of my thesis is given in [this](https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/ProteinLigandDataCollection) repository. This was the first step into software development.After my master, I combined both knowledge from math and computer sciences; and worked on chemical graph generators in my PhD. For more details, please look at my [CV](https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/MehmetAzizYirik.github.io/blob/main/Docs/CV-Yirik.pdf).

Besides sciences, I love fine arts, such as movies, music, and dance. I am the producer of the short documentary called [Mountain of Servants](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4329702/?ref_=login) about Assyrian minority in south-eastern Turkey, directed by [Daniel Lombroso](http://www.daniellombroso.com). I also like the combination of modern and traditional ethnic art. I have two good examples: One of my favorite artists is [Hikmet Barutçugil](http://www.ebristan.com/?s=10), inspired by the beauty of symmetry in nature and has this great artwork, his book called [Symmetry](http://www.ebristan.com/?s=14). Some of its images are given [here](http://www.ebristan.com/?d=galeri&gid=13). The other one is [Gülnihal Gül Mamat](https://www.instagram.com/gulnihalgulmamat/?hl=en), mainly working on modern [kufic caligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kufic). She is also the designer of [MAYGEN logo](https://github.com/MehmetAzizYirik/MAYGEN/blob/main/docs/logo.png)
